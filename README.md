## Help info

In this game the goal is to find and open the treasure chest hidden somewhere in a labyrinth on a tropical island. You will know you are near the chest when “Your heart starts to race.” To open the treasure chest, you must collect one of the two keys on the map. You will know there is a key nearby because the game will print “You see a small glint”. The key is one of two items that can be picked up, you may also pick up planks, there is no clue for when a plank is nearby. Some areas will have quicksand, you will know you are near quicksand because the game will print “The ground starts to soften”. If you enter a quicksand area without a plank, you will be stuck, and the game is over. When moving around you may get hit in the head by falling coconuts. While dazed you may wander a little and lose track of where you are. You will know falling coconuts are nearby when the game prints “You hear a thunk.”
